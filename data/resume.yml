      tech: PHP / Internally developed MVC Framework - MS SQL Server

      description: |
         Programmed a market research study focused on business technology buyers, their purchasing cycles and research habits. After developing the survey, I worked alongside our lead developer to create a reporting portal that gave media planners the ability to use the aggregate survey results to help guide their marketing and media planning. I worked with the lead programmer and our market research scientist to understand and determine the feasibility of programming particular methodologies.

    - name: Translation Module
      tech: PHP - MySQL
      description: |
          Allowed a user to upload an XML translation file generated by our survey design tool. The file was reformatted for easier use by our translation vendors. Once the vendor returned the files with translations in place, they were converted back to the format our survey design client required. This tool reduced the time spent importing text for each language from over half a day to under half an hour as well as reducing the amount of error in the resulting import.
