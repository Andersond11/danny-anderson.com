    %h1 Software Developer

    %p My interest in software development began with an early version of Macromedia Flash. I was enamored with the ability to create images and easily attach logic. A few of my early tinkerings caught the interest of a friend and web designer, which led to us partnering on freelance jobs. I spent several years as a touring musician working freelance software development jobs from the road. These jobs varied from data-driven, touch screen applications written in FlashActionscript 3 to corporate site managers written in PHPMySQL.

    %p After several years, I grew tired of the financial ups and downs of freelancing and decided to look for a full time position. I quickly found a home as a survey and software developer with the local market research company, Mindwave Research.

    %p It was during my time with Mindwave that I discovered Ruby. The more I played with Ruby at night, the more disheartened I grew working in PHP each day. In talking with my former freelancing partner, I discovered that the company he was working for needed help with a legacy Rails application that their company heavily depended on. 

    %p I started with TWGPlus in March of 2013 and have taken on numerous roles since starting, including front-end developer, creating responsive marketing sites for our clients; application developer, maintaining and improving the CMSreporting application that the business relies on; sysadmin, managing the EC2 instance and eventually creating puppet scripts which were used to relaunch and stabilize their staging and development environments.
